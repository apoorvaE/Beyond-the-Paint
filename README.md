**My Art Journey**

## The Beginning

  The magestic sweep of the final brush stroke, pressed into a stunning shade of cadmium blue paint. Perfect! It usually takes me as well as many other artists, a multitude of hours to finally reach this stage in their art. Drawing and even crafts was a part of my life for more than ten years and I could not have imagined how it would have been if I was never given the abiliy to express myself in such a creative way. My mother told me that the first drawing I ever did, was scribbling all over our brand new television. I know, I know, not a smart decision. But, that is when it all began and it is a moment that I will hold dear to my heart. It unlocked a pathway in my future years for me to make so many pieces of so many genres. These included, painting, drawing, crafts, pottery, embroidery, and hopefully many more to in the next coming years.

## The Struggle of Art Block

  Art Block. When you have absolutely no creativity, interest, or motivation for a piece. This often occurs in the beginning stage of first making your work. Individuals usually spend searching for the perfect picture to feature or thinking of the exact image they desire to create, and by the end of those hours, all the creativity they had left in them is gone. I often struggle with this because I want to start on a piece, but i often do not know where to start and new ideas just do not come to me at the time. But I usually conquer this by taking a break from the art I was working on and taking a bit of a "break" time. By decreasing the pressure I had put on myself, I automatically start creating the new goals and ideas that I want to include. That tip might help some people but I still acknowledge that a few others would still struggle with this despite taking a break. A quick episode never hurt anyone! **YOU CAN DO IT!**

  One of my favorite artists is, _kelogsloops_ and his art style is truly gorgeous. I often try to look on his youtube channel for inspiration and it usually works. These include things such as, helping me find nice color combinations or even to just feel inspired to begin my next piece. 

  Here is his youtube channel if you want to check it out! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_9ObjTaq4kIvuVCJgHPPRw
